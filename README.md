<h1> Image Classifier App Overview: </h1>

  -A simple web application that classifies uploaded images into predefined categories using TensorFlow for the model and Streamlit for the UI.
The goal is to demonstrate a clean machine-learning workflowâ€”data preprocessing, model training, and interactive deployment

<h3>Features:</h3>

-Upload an image and instantly see the predicted class and confidence score.

-Lightweight web interface with Streamlit (no HTML/CSS required).

-Modular Python code: easy to retrain or swap the model.

<h3>Installation and setup:</h3>

Bash commands:

  -git clone https://github.com/FilipMihajlov1/Image-Classifier.git
  
  -cd Image-Classifier
